# GED Test Taker Improvement Strategies
This project analyzes disparities in GED test performance across geographic (state) and demographic groups (ethnicity) in the United States. Leverage exploratory data analysis and clustering to provide data-driven insights that support underserved student populations and promote educational equity.

## Key Deliverables
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Uncovered trends across race, geography, test behavior, and prep methods.
- Clustering Analysis: Segmented test-takers into three clusters to guide targeted outreach.
- Strategic Recommendations: Tailored interventions based on insights to improve GED success rates in specific regions and populations.

## Key Insights
- Demographic Gaps: African American and Hispanic/Latino test-takers show lower pass rates than White and Asian counterparts.
- Prep Strategies Matter: Test-takers using multiple prep resources or mobile/online formats have significantly higher pass rates.
- Geography: States like Georgia, Kentucky, and Illinois have higher proportions of struggling candidates.
- Cluster Highlights:
  - Cluster 1: Moderate success with limited prep.
  - Cluster 2: High success, well-prepared (ideal group).
  - Cluster 3: Low success, minimal engagement (needs targeted support).

## Recommendations
- Expand online learning options in underserved rural areas.
- Promote peer support and language-accessible prep resources for diverse communities.
- Amplify use of proven prep methods among low-engagement clusters.
- Partner with local organizations to improve awareness and outreach.
